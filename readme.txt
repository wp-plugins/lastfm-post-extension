This Plugin automagically adds the last scrobbled Song to your published Post.

== Description ==

It gets the last song you listened to from your Last.fm Profile and add its to your Posts Metadata.
Via the Tagfunction `the_music()` you can show the formated song information on your post page.
No Last.fm Password is needed, only your Username.

== Individualisation ==
There a three possibilitys to change `Last.fm Post Extension` public Appearance:
* Setting up the Format String in Last.Fm Post Extensions Options Page (Admin -> Plugins)
* Editing `lastfmpostext.css`
* Edit the $output Var in `lastfmpostext.php` `the_music()`
 
== Requirements ==

Unfortunaly i'm a lazy guy. So there is no PHP4 support since it uses the SimpleXML Class, 
which is only included in PHP5. But PHP4 is obsolete anyway, so this is a good opportunity to get rid of it.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the Folder `lastfm-post-extension` to your `\wp-content\plugins\` Folder
1. LogIn and active the Plugin in Wordpress 'Plugin' Menu
1. Setup Last.fm Username, Timeout and Link Layout in `Last.fm Post Ext` Options Page
1. Go to the Design Section of Wordpress Backend -> Theme Editor -> `index.php`
1. Place `<?=the_music()?>` somewhere. I suggest you do it either directly under the header or in the meta box of the post (look at screenshot-2.png)
1. Do the same in `single.php` and `archiv.php`
1. Happy Posting. You might leave me a short comment under the donatation url.
